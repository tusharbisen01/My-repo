👋 Hi, I’m Tushar Bisen

I’m a passionate DevOps Engineer focused on building scalable, secure, and automated cloud infrastructures. I enjoy working end-to-end across CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes clusters, cloud platforms, and modern DevOps tooling. I’m currently working on multiple real-time projects involving AWS, Terraform, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes (EKS/Minikube), Helm, SonarQube, and full-stack deployments.

I’m actively improving my expertise in Cloud Platform Engineering, DevOps workflows, Linux fundamentals, container orchestration, and large-scale application deployments. Alongside this, I am also exploring autonomous vehicles and AI/ML, which I’m using for my major academic project.

I love solving real-world infrastructure problems, automating workflows, optimizing deployments, and sharing what I learn through LinkedIn to help others grow in the DevOps domain.

🔥 What I Do

Build and maintain production-grade CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins

Deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes (EKS, Minikube)

Automate AWS infrastructure using Terraform

Containerize applications using Docker & Docker Compose

Manage monitoring & observability using Prometheus–Grafana stack

Implement secure deployments using Kubernetes Secrets & IAM roles

Work on real-time DevOps use cases like blue-green & rolling deployments

🚀 Tech Stack & Tools

AWS, Terraform, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Linux, GitHub Actions, SonarQube, Nginx, Prometheus, Grafana, Python, Django, React, MySQL, MongoDB

🎯 Current Goals

Become a strong Cloud/DevOps Platform Engineer

Master Kubernetes internals, Helm, and production-level scaling

Build impactful projects and contribute more to the open-source community

Share my learning journey openly to help others break into DevOps
